# Gentrification Project

The goal of this project is to develop methods for exploring gentrification process at a finer space time scale. Conventional census-based methods and new data mining approach including text processing, text clustering, and image recognition are used for this project. These methods were applied to Salt Lake City in Utah, and the results can be found on my personal website: https://cheng-chia.github.io/

A part of this project becomes my thesis defended on July 11, 2017:
*"Developing a Data Mining Framework to Identify a Sense of Gentrification through Social Media Data: A Case Study Using Instagram Posts in Salt Lake City, Utah"*


This repository are divided into five folders: 
* explore IG posings pattern: this folder contains a code for exploring the temporal and space time pattern of IG posting. It provides an overview of the Instagram dataset.
* thesis summary: this folder contains the thesis abstract and the slides 
* typology: this folder contains codes which are able to replicate five existing census-based gentrification typologies as long as the database is established.
* text clustering: this folder contains codes for applying text clustering to Instagram text.
* image recognition and sentiment analysis: this folder contains codes for applying image recognition and sentiment analysis to Instagram photos.
