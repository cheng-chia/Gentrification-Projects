## Exploring Instagram Posting Pattern

#### This code is used to query and aggregate Instagram data from the Mongo database, apply geoprocessing, and create space time cube. By doing this, we have a general understanding of the Instagram posts before conducting other data mining methods. The snapshots below are the results after running this code.

#
*   The Hourly Posting Behavior: most Instagram posts were posted between 10AM to 10PM, and the peak appears between 20PM to 21PM. Additionally, the counts of Instagram posts significantly increased over years.
